Rossmann Pharmacies Sales Forecast Project

The demand for a product or service keeps changing from time to time. No business can improve its financial performance without estimating customer demand and future sales of products/services accurately. Sales forecasting refers to the process of estimating demand for or sales of a particular product over a specific period of time.

This project aims to develop a sales forecast system for the Rossmann company, a chain of over 3,000 pharmacies operating in 7 European countries. The need arose after a results meeting, in which Rossmann store managers were tasked with providing daily sales forecasts for the next six weeks. With over a thousand managers requesting their own forecasts, the challenge is to create an accurate and efficient solution that considers the peculiarities of each store, including factors such as promotions, competition, schools, holidays, seasonality, and locality.
